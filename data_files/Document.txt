My dear Clara,
The information that Summer has found about this new star
has been an astonishing discovery! I believe that she's
even found a new planet. I've taken her documents and 
published them as my own. I could be rewarded greatly 
for Summer's hard work - I'll make sure you aren't left
out too so long as you keep this secret between us. 
I can see it now, planet Atkins!                                                                                                              With love,                                                                                                                        James Atkins
